# CREATE-TWINIT-APP

create-twinit-app scaffolds a new Twinit React client application much in the same way the create-react-app initializes a new react application.

## Running create-twinit-app

Before running create-twinit-app you may want to gather the follow information, as create-twinit-app will prompt you for it.
You may instead accept the defaults all the way through, and update the information later as well.

* Your application name (default: 'my-twinit-react-client')
* Your application description (default: 'My Twinit React Client Description')
* Your application version (default: '1.0.0')
* Your application author (default: 'None')
* Your Twinit Application ID (default: 'The Twinit Academy Training Application ID')
* Your Twinit application's user config _userType (default: 'dev-train')
* The Twinit API instance your client will connect to (default: 'https://sandbox-api.invicara.com')

When ready run:

```
npx create-twinit-app
```
